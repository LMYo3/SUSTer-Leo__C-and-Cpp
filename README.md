# SUSTer-Leo__C-and-Cpp
This repository collects code that is common when learning C (C++) in the first year of college, and since the author was in his freshman year at the time of creation, it is inevitable that there are slightly immature points in the code. The repository is continuously updated. At the same time, the author was an automation student of Shaanxi University of Science and Technology when he was created, and welcomes the guidance of students from our university and non-students from this university!
